The trained machine learning model predicts whether a job posting is fake or real based on patterns and features learned during the training process. Hereâ€™s how it works:
How the Machine is Trained

    Data Preparation
        The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, remove irrelevant data, and prepare it for analysis.
        Text-based fields (e.g., job title, description) are combined into a single feature to analyze the context of the job posting.

    FeaFture Extraction
        Text Features: Processed using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical vectors, capturing the importance of words in a job posting.
        Numerical Features: Non-text columns (e.g., telecommuting, has_company_logo) are directly used to provide additional context.

    Hybrid Model Construction
        The hybrid model combines the predictions of multiple base algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using a Stacking Classifier.
        Each base model identifies patterns in the data:
            Logistic Regression captures linear relationships.
            Random Forest identifies complex decision boundaries using ensembles of decision trees.
            Gradient Boosting enhances predictions by focusing on misclassified samples.
        A final meta-classifier (another Logistic Regression) takes the predictions of the base models and learns from their combined strengths to make a final decision.

    Training the Model
        The model is trained on the training dataset, learning patterns that distinguish fake from real job postings.
        It uses the labeled data (fraudulent column) to understand which characteristics are associated with fake and real jobs.

    Evaluation
        After training, the model is tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

How the Model Predicts

    Input Processing
        When a new job posting is provided, its text features (title, description, etc.) are combined and transformed using the same TF-IDF vectorizer that was used during training.
        Numerical features (e.g., telecommuting, has_company_logo) are appended to the vectorized text features.

    Prediction Pipeline
        The combined features are passed through the trained hybrid model.
        Each base model makes a prediction (fake or real).
        The meta-classifier analyzes these predictions to make the final decision.

    Output
        The model outputs a label: 1 (Fake) or 0 (Real), along with probabilities for each class.

How the Model Identifies Fake vs. Real

The model looks for certain patterns in the job postings that are characteristic of fake jobs:

    Fake Jobs:
        Overuse of certain words like "Earn," "Easy Money," "Work from Home."
        Lack of a company profile or vague descriptions.
        Absence of screening questions or a company logo.
        Unrealistic benefits or requirements.
    Real Jobs:
        Detailed job descriptions with specific responsibilities and qualifications.
        Presence of a legitimate company profile.
        Screening questions and a professional company logo.
        Reasonable benefits and requirements.

Example

Fake Job Input:

    Title: "Work from Home - Easy Money"
    Description: "Earn $500 per day with no experience."
    Telecommuting: Yes
    Has Company Logo: No
    Has Screening Questions: No

The model detects:

    High presence of suspicious keywords ("Work from Home," "Easy Money").
    No screening questions or company logo.
    Likely a fake job -> Predicts Fake.

Real Job Input:

    Title: "Full-Stack Developer"
    Description: "Develop and maintain applications. 3+ years experience required."
    Telecommuting: No
    Has Company Logo: Yes
    Has Screening Questions: Yes

The model identifies:

    Specific job title and detailed description.
    Presence of screening questions and company logo.
    Likely a legitimate job -> Predicts Real.
